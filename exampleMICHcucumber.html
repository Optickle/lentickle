    %% Choosing RF demod phases

    % about the control system, we can use it to modify the Optickle model
    % to make certain sensors have maximum response to certain degrees of
    % freedom. (Example, you want DARM to be mostly coupled to AS_Q not
    % AS_I.)
    
    % Let's prepare the arguments for the phasing function.
    
    phaseAS = struct( 'Iname', 'AS_I', ... % name of the I sensor
                      'Qname', 'AS_Q', ... % name of the Q sensor
                      'IorQ',  'Q',    ... % maximize I or Q?
                      'DOF',   'DIFF');    % maximize which DOF?

    phaseREFL = struct( 'Iname', 'REFL_I', ...
